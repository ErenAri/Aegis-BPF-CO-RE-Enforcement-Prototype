# External Validation

This document tracks **public, third-party validation** of AegisBPF. We do not
claim independent review unless it is recorded here with a verifiable summary.

## Transparency status (current)

**As of 2026-02-06:** no independent security review has been published and no
pilot case study has been published. We will update this page immediately when
that changes.

If you are evaluating AegisBPF, assume **no external validation** unless a
dated entry appears under “Published reviews” or “Pilot case studies.”
