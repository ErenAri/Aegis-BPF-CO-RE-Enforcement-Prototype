# Go-Live Checklist

This checklist is the final go/no-go gate for a senior-level production
release.

Use one row per release candidate (RC). Every item must be marked pass with
attached evidence.

Evidence entries must include direct URLs (workflow run, artifact, dashboard,
or incident ticket) rather than free-form notes.
