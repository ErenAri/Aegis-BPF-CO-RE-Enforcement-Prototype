**Date:** 2026-02-07
**Auditor:** Security Analysis
**Scope:** Ed25519 signature verification and timing attack prevention
**Status:**  MOSTLY SECURE (1 minor issue found)

## Executive Summary

AegisBPF's Ed25519 signature verification implementation is **well-designed and uses constant-time operations** for the critical signature verification path. The project uses TweetNaCl, a security-focused cryptographic library designed to resist timing attacks.

**Finding:** 1 MINOR timing leak in trusted key lookup (LOW severity, difficult to exploit)

---

## Audit Scope

### Files Audited

## Findings

###  SECURE: Ed25519 Signature Verification

**Location:** `src/crypto.cpp:138-141`

```cpp
bool verify_bytes(const uint8_t* data, size_t data_len,
                  const Signature& signature, const PublicKey& public_key)
{
    return crypto_sign_verify_detached(signature.data(), data,
                                       data_len, public_key.data()) == 0;
}
```

**Analysis:**
Uses TweetNaCl's `crypto_sign_verify_detached()` which calls `crypto_sign_open()`.

**Evidence of Constant-Time:** `src/tweetnacl.c:537`
```c
if (crypto_verify_32(sm, t)) {  // Line 537
```

The critical comparison uses `crypto_verify_32()`:

```c
static int vn(const u8* x, const u8* y, int n) {
    u64 d = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) d |= x[i] ^ y[i];  // No branching
    return (1 & ((d - 1) >> 8)) - 1;  // Constant-time result
}

static int crypto_verify_32(const u8* x, const u8* y) {
    return vn(x, y, 32);
}
```

**Verdict:**  **SECURE** - Uses constant-time comparison via bit manipulation, no early exit

---

###  SECURE: SHA-256 Hash Comparison

**Location:** `src/crypto.cpp:341`

```cpp
if (!constant_time_hex_compare(computed_sha256, bundle.policy_sha256)) {
    return Error(ErrorCode::IntegrityCheckFailed, "Policy SHA256 mismatch");
}
```

**Implementation:** `src/sha256.cpp:272-289`

```cpp
bool constant_time_hex_compare(const std::string& a, const std::string& b)
{
    if (a.size() != b.size()) {
        return false;  // Early exit acceptable for length mismatch
    }

    // Accumulate differences without early exit
    volatile unsigned char result = 0;
    for (size_t i = 0; i < a.size(); ++i) {
        unsigned char ca = static_cast<unsigned char>(std::tolower(...));
        unsigned char cb = static_cast<unsigned char>(std::tolower(...));
        result = static_cast<unsigned char>(result | (ca ^ cb));
    }
    return result == 0;
}
```

**Verdict:**  **SECURE** - Uses `volatile` to prevent compiler optimization, no branching in comparison loop

---

###  MINOR ISSUE: Trusted Key Lookup

**Location:** `src/crypto.cpp:347-348`

```cpp
bool key_trusted = std::any_of(trusted_keys.begin(), trusted_keys.end(),
    [&bundle](const auto& trusted) { return trusted == bundle.signer_key; });
```

**Issue:** Uses `std::array::operator==` which is NOT constant-time

**Impact:** LOW SEVERITY
- Timing leak reveals which trusted key index matches (or if no match)
- Attacker needs:
  1. Precise timing measurement (nanosecond resolution)
  2. Multiple signature verification attempts
  3. Control over which key signs bundles
- **Exploitability:** Very difficult in practice

**Typical timing differences:**
- First key match: ~10-50ns
- Last key match: ~10-50ns × number_of_keys
- No match: ~10-50ns × number_of_keys

**Attack scenario:**
```
Trusted keys: [key_A, key_B, key_C]
Bundle signed by key_B:
  - Comparison with key_A: ~20ns (mismatch at some byte)
  - Comparison with key_B: ~30ns (full match)
  - Total: ~50ns

Bundle signed by key_C:
  - Comparison with key_A: ~20ns
  - Comparison with key_B: ~20ns
  - Comparison with key_C: ~30ns
  - Total: ~70ns

Time delta: ~20ns reveals key index
```

---

### Recommended Fix (Optional)

Replace `operator==` with constant-time comparison:

```cpp
bool keys_match_constant_time(const PublicKey& a, const PublicKey& b) {
    volatile unsigned char diff = 0;
    for (size_t i = 0; i < kPublicKeySize; ++i) {
        diff |= a[i] ^ b[i];
    }
    return diff == 0;
}

// In verify_bundle():
bool key_trusted = std::any_of(trusted_keys.begin(), trusted_keys.end(),
    [&bundle](const auto& trusted) {
        return keys_match_constant_time(trusted, bundle.signer_key);
    });
```

**Note:** Even with this fix, the number of iterations (trusted_keys.size()) leaks the key index position, but requires more sophisticated timing analysis.

## Signature Verification Flow

```
User Policy Bundle
        ↓
parse_signed_bundle() - Extracts metadata + signature
        ↓
verify_bundle() - Main verification function
        ↓
    
     1. SHA256 Comparison (CONSTANT-TIME) 
        constant_time_hex_compare()           
    
        ↓
    
     2. Trusted Key Lookup (NOT CT)       
        std::any_of + operator==              
    
        ↓
    
     3. Ed25519 Verify (CONSTANT-TIME)    
        crypto_sign_verify_detached()         
          → crypto_sign_open()                
            → crypto_verify_32()           
    
        ↓
    Success or Failure
```

## Test Coverage

### Existing Tests
-  `CmdPolicySignTest.CreatesSignedBundle` - Bundle creation
-  `CmdPolicySignTest.RejectsInvalidKeyEncoding` - Key validation
-  `CmdPolicyApplySignedTest.RequireSignatureRejectsUnsignedPolicy` - Signature required
-  `CmdPolicyApplySignedTest.RejectsCorruptedBundleSignature` - Signature integrity
-  `KeyLifecycleTest.RotateAndRevokeTrustedSigningKeys` - Key rotation

### Missing Test (Recommended)
Add timing attack fuzzing test:

```cpp
TEST(TimingAttackTest, SignatureVerificationIsConstantTime) {
    // Generate 1000 signatures with varying bit patterns
    // Measure verification time for each
    // Statistical analysis should show no correlation between
    // bit pattern and verification time
}
```

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Overall |
|------|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Ed25519 timing leak** |  None | N/A |  SAFE |
| **SHA256 timing leak** |  None | N/A |  SAFE |
| **Key lookup timing leak** |  Low | Low |  LOW |

### Key Lookup Timing Leak Details

**Likelihood:** LOW
- Requires nanosecond-precision timing
- Requires network access to trigger multiple verifications
- Requires control over which key signs bundles
- Mitigated by jitter from OS scheduler, network latency, CPU caches

**Impact:** LOW
- Only reveals which trusted key was used (not the key itself)
- Trusted keys are already public (.pub files)
- Does not compromise key material or signature security
- Does not bypass signature verification

**Real-world Exploitability:** VERY LOW
- Remote timing attacks require thousands of samples
- AegisBPF verification happens server-side (not exposed to network)
- Key index information has minimal value (keys are public)

---

## Compliance & Best Practices

###  COMPLIANT
- [x] Uses established cryptographic library (TweetNaCl)
- [x] Constant-time signature verification
- [x] Constant-time hash comparison
- [x] No secret-dependent branching in crypto operations
- [x] Proper use of `volatile` to prevent compiler optimization
- [x] Public domain crypto (no licensing issues)

###  RECOMMENDATIONS
- [ ] Add constant-time key lookup (optional, low priority)
- [ ] Add timing attack fuzzing test (recommended)
- [ ] Document crypto assumptions in developer guide

---

## Conclusion

**Overall Security Rating:**  (5/5)

AegisBPF's cryptographic implementation is **production-ready from a timing attack perspective**. The use of TweetNaCl and constant-time comparison functions demonstrates good security awareness.

The minor timing leak in trusted key lookup is:
1. **Not a vulnerability** - does not compromise signature security
2. **Low impact** - only leaks key index (keys are public)
3. **Difficult to exploit** - requires precise timing and multiple samples
4. **Optional to fix** - can be addressed in future hardening if desired

### Recommendations Priority

1. **HIGH (Optional):** Add timing attack fuzzing test to CI
2. **LOW (Optional):** Implement constant-time key lookup
3. **LOW (Optional):** Document cryptographic guarantees in `docs/CRYPTOGRAPHY.md`

### Production Deployment Decision

 **APPROVED** - No blocking cryptographic security issues found

The Ed25519 signature verification path is properly implemented with constant-time operations. The minor timing leak in key lookup does not pose a significant security risk for production deployment.
