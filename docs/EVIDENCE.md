# Public Evidence Pack

This document maps AegisBPF’s public claims to **verifiable, public CI artifacts**.
All evidence is generated by GitHub Actions workflows and published as build
artifacts on each run.

## How to access evidence

1. Open the **Actions** tab in GitHub.
2. Choose the workflow listed below (e.g., **Perf Regression**).
3. Open the latest run and download the **Artifacts**.

## Evidence map

| Claim area | Workflow | Artifact(s) | Notes |
|------------|----------|-------------|-------|
| Build + unit tests + sanitizers | `CI` (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) | `coverage-report` (HTML), `sbom` | Coverage report + SBOM are published as artifacts. |
| Kernel portability | `Kernel Matrix` (`.github/workflows/kernel-matrix.yml`) | `kernel-matrix-<runner>` | Includes kernel + OS details and ctest log. |
| Edge‑case compliance | `Kernel Matrix` + `E2E (BPF LSM)` | `kernel-matrix-<runner>`, `e2e-evidence` | File‑enforcement matrix and edge‑case behaviors. |
| BPF LSM E2E validation | `E2E (BPF LSM)` (`.github/workflows/e2e.yml`) | `e2e-evidence` | Includes environment info, soak summary, and chaos ringbuf overflow result. |
| Perf regression (self-hosted) | `Perf Regression` (`.github/workflows/perf.yml`) | `perf-evidence` | Includes open/close microbench + workload suite JSON. |
| Soak reliability (self-hosted) | `Soak Reliability` (`.github/workflows/soak.yml`) | `soak-evidence` | Includes soak summary JSON with drop/RSS thresholds. |
| Release readiness | `Release Readiness` (`.github/workflows/release-readiness.yml`) | (status only) | Status gate for release readiness script. |
| Security scans | `Security` (`.github/workflows/security.yml`) | (status only) | CodeQL, gitleaks, semgrep results. |
| External validation | (manual) | `docs/EXTERNAL_VALIDATION.md` | Public summaries of independent reviews or pilot case studies. |

## Latest evidence runs

- Kernel Matrix (dispatch): 2026-02-06
  - Run: https://github.com/ErenAri/Aegis-BPF-CO-RE-Enforcement-Prototype/actions/runs/21735329269
  - Artifacts: `kernel-matrix-kernel-5.14`, `kernel-matrix-kernel-6.1`, `kernel-matrix-kernel-6.5`, `kernel-matrix-kernel-6.8`
- External validation: **none published** (see `docs/EXTERNAL_VALIDATION.md`)
- Perf baseline: **pending** (see `docs/PERF_BASELINE.md`)
- Edge‑case compliance results: **pending** (see `docs/EDGE_CASE_COMPLIANCE_RESULTS.md`)

## Evidence expectations

- **Self-hosted evidence** (kernel matrix, perf, soak) requires tagged runners.
- **Hosted evidence** (CI, security scans, SBOM, coverage) should be present on
  every PR and main run.
- **External validation** is only listed once a public summary exists.

## Kernel matrix coverage

Target runners for portability evidence (self-hosted):

| Runner label | Kernel target | Evidence artifact |
|-------------|---------------|-------------------|
| `kernel-5.14` | 5.14.x | `kernel-matrix-kernel-5.14` |
| `kernel-6.8` | 6.8.x | `kernel-matrix-kernel-6.8` |
| `kernel-6.1` | 6.1.x | `kernel-matrix-kernel-6.1` |
| `kernel-6.5` | 6.5.x | `kernel-matrix-kernel-6.5` |

## Perf evidence trend

- **Self-hosted perf artifacts:** `perf-evidence` (from `Perf Regression`).
- **Benchmark trend history:** `benchmark.yml` publishes to `gh-pages` under
  `dev/bench/` for long-term trend visualization.

If an artifact is missing, check the workflow log for runner availability or
permission issues.
